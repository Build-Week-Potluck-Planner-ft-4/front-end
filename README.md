# Potluck Planner

Your one-stop shop for all things potluck!

This program will allow you to make an account and log in to a web app designed to make potluck planning easy. With a simple, easy to use interface, it cuts straight to the basics to get your event planned and ready to share in just a few minutes!

How to use this application:

1. Sign up with username, email (doesn't need a real email address), and password.
2. Once you make an account, you need to log in.
3. From the dashboard, click on "Create New Potluck" to organize an event.
4. Once you submit, you will be redirected to the dashboard, where you should see the new event.
5. As an organizer, you can request items to be brought and invite users via their username (but cannot remove guests/items).
6. People who have accounts that have been invited to a potluck can view the event details from their dashboard, and can see attendees and items that are needed.

Notes:

This software's development has been put on hold, indefinitely, and is not 100% stable or practical to use; however, it is working enough that (at the time of writing this | 21 OCT 2021) you can sign up, login in, create events, and invite other users of the site to them.

This is more a proof of concept than release ready software, so understand this if you plan on using it. The code is open source and on an MIT license, if you want to look/fork/make changes.

This is a first mock-up for MVP, subject to change, but adequate for getting on the road.

Development is on hold indefinitely, and is not in a release-ready state; it is a proof of concept, and was made for educational purposes. All code for the front-end is in this repo under an MIT license.
